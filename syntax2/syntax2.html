			<div class="unfold">
			<p>
Following on from a number of first-year syntax courses offered at the University of Konstanz, this course serves to deepen and broaden students' knowledge of generative syntactic theory. The course is roughly divided into three phases: a recapitulation of the topics in English syntax discussed in first-year syntax courses (the first 4 to 5 seminars), an introduction to more advanced topics in English syntax (the middle few seminars), and an introduction to German syntax with a focus on how German differs from English (the last 4 seminars). The course will move quickly through topics with which students should have some familiarity, and will slow down when new material is presented.
<br><br>
The theoretical framework adopted is contemporary <a class="sup" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transformational_grammar" target="_blank">Mainstream Generative Grammar</a>, which is the most widely-used framework among syntacticians. The first 4 or 5 seminars are intended to help students unfamiliar with this framework (i.e. students come from an <a class="sup" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lexical_functional_grammar" target="_blank">LFG</a> background) to orientate themselves in this system.
</p><br>
			</div>
			</li>
		
			<li>
			<p class="fold"><a>Aims and learning outcomes</a></p>
			<div class="unfold">
			<p>
Syntactic theory has been at the centre of modern formal linguists since its inception in the late 1950s. A sound understanding of syntactic theory is crucial for effective research in any other subfield of linguistics, from Neurolinguistics to Pragmatics. A background in formal syntax is useful for teaching language and grammar at all educational levels. More generally, engaging with syntactic theory helps to develop and refine transferable analytical and argumentative skills.
<br><br>

In this class, students will develop and refine their analytical skills through applying them to a variety of familiar and unfamiliar syntactic puzzles and problems, predominantly from English and German.</p>

<p><ul class="disc"> <b>Learning outcomes</b>
<li>An ability to identify syntactic phenomena and categorise them according to their affect on the grammar of natural language.</li> 
<li>An ability to recall/identify syntactic rules and constraints and assess their efficacy.</li>
<li>An ability to identify syntactic patterns in linguistic data and construct generalisations therefrom.</li>
</ul></p><br>
</div>
</li>

<li>
<p class="fold"><a>Workload</a></p>
<div class="unfold">
<p>
This course is worth 6 ECTS credits, which corresponds to between 150 and 180 hours of work (one credit = 25 to 30 hours of work). Because we will have 22.5 hours of contact-time (i.e. one 1.5 hour seminar every week for 15 weeks), much of this work will be done outside of the classroom.
<br><br>

Consequently, students will receive additional reading tasks and homework assignments for the first 10 weeks or so. Reading tasks and homework assignments for each week will be bundled together as .zip file, which will be uploaded to this website after each seminar (click the <b>materials</b> tab at the top of this page). Students unfamiliar with .zip files should google "extract zip files {windows/mac/linux/android}" for instructions. Additional reading tasks and homework assignments should be tackled in the order suggested.
<br><br>

There is no dedicated textbook for this course. Scanned excerpts will be provided when necessary.
<br><br>
After 10 weeks or so, the remaining time outside of the classroom is reserved for revision for the final exam.

			<div class="unfold">
			
			<ul class="disc">
			<li>5% &nbsp&nbsp= Attendance and participation
			<li>30% = Homework assignments</li>
			<li>65% = Final exam</li>
			</ul><p>
			<br>
			<b>Attendance and participation</b><br>
Students are expected to attend all of the seminars (for information about missing seminars, please see the 'policies' section below). Students should be prepared to complete exercises during seminars as part of a group, and are expected to contribute equally to this group work. Students are also expected to complete every homework exercise assigned to them and submit each one on time.
<br><br>

<b>Homework assignments</b><br>
Students will receive homework assignments every week for the first 8 (or maybe 9 or 10) weeks. Homework can be done individually or in groups of up to 4 students. The cumulative score for homework assignments is worth 30% of the final grade for the course.
<br><br>
Be aware that there won't be much time to go through the previous week's homework during seminars. As a consequence, we will only go through the homework exercise from the previous week that students found most difficult. This will happen during the first 15 minutes of each seminar.		
<br><br>

<b>How and when to submit homework assignments</b><br>

Homework must be submitted before 17:00 on the Wednesday that follows the seminar in which the homework was assigned. Any homework submission received after this deadline will not be graded and will therefore receive 0%.
<br><br>
Homework assignments must be submitted electronically to my email address, which is james.griffiths@uni-konstanz.de. Answers to questions can either be placed directly in the body of an email, or be sent as a .docx/.odt/.pdf file. Students must put their name and student number on all homework submissions. If homework is being done as a group, each member of group must put his/her/their name and student number on the submission. Only one member of the group should email me: there is no need for every member to send me duplicates.
<br><br>
Some of the homework assignments will require students to draw syntax trees. Syntax trees can be generated electronically (using MS Word's drawing tools or using LaTeX packages such as <i>forest</i>) or alternatively syntax trees can be hand-drawn on paper and then photographed using a smart phone or similar device. The photographs can be emailed to me as .jpg or .png images. These images must be legible, and must include name(s) and student number(s). Again, syntax trees drawn by a group should only be sent to me by one member of the group. It must be clear in all homework submissions precisely which questions are being answered.
<br><br>
The homework exercises are either created by me or taken from obscure textbooks. Students won't find the answers online or easily in print, so they shouldn't waste their time trying!
<br><br>

<b>The final exam</b><br>
The final exam will take place on Friday 16 February 2018, and will occupy the entire final  seminar (in other words, students will be given 1.5 hours to complete the exam). The final exam is done individually (i.e. <b>not</b> in groups), and is worth 65% of the final grade for the course. The questions on the exam will cover topics from all of the preceding seminars. Students may only take stationary (pens, pencils, rulers, etc.) into the exam. No exam aids (notes, revision cards, etc.) can be taken into the exam.
<br><br>
Final exam submissions will be subject to standard tests for plagiarism. If discovered, plagiarism will be dealt with in accordance with University of Konstanz's outstanding policies.
<br><br>
<b>The final grade</b><br>
The scores from the homework and the exams, which are likely to undergo some form of statistical normalisation, will be added together to produce a final grade, given as a percentage. These percentages translate into the Konstanz grading system as follows:
			<br>
			<table>
			<tr><td style="padding-right: 20px">95% or above</td><td>1</td></tr>
			<tr><td style="padding-right: 20px">90% or above</td><td>1,3</td></tr>
			<tr><td style="padding-right: 20px">85% or above</td><td>1,7</td></tr>
			<tr><td style="padding-right: 20px">80% or above</td><td>2</td></tr>
			<tr><td style="padding-right: 20px">75% or above</td><td>2,3</td></tr>
			<tr><td style="padding-right: 20px">70% or above</td><td>2,7</td></tr>
			<tr><td style="padding-right: 20px">65% or above</td><td>3</td></tr>
			<tr><td style="padding-right: 20px">60% or above</td><td>3,3</td></tr>
			<tr><td style="padding-right: 20px">55% or above</td><td>3,7</td></tr>
			<tr><td style="padding-right: 20px">50% or above</td><td>4</td></tr>
			<tr><td style="padding-right: 20px">49% or below</td><td>5</td></tr>
			</table>
<br>
Students who have a final grade of 49% or below (which corresponds to a 5 in the Konstanz system) will fail the course. A decision on whether the exam can be re-sat has not yet been taken. I will let students know in due course.
<br><br>
For bureaucratic reasons, students must enroll on the <a class="sup" href="https://studis.uni-konstanz.de/" target="_blank">StudIS</a> system between 01 December 2017 and 15 January 2018 to be eligible for a final grade. Please add this to your calendar!

			<p class="fold"><a>Policies</a></p>
			<div class="unfold">
			<p>
<b>Language of instruction</b><br>
The working language of this course is English. Seminars will be conducted in English and the provided reading material will be written in English. Students must submit homework assignments  in English, and must write their answers during the final exam in English.
<br><br>

<b>Office-hour appointments</b><br>
This course is meant to be stimulating and challenging, but not overwhelming. So if you need help, please ask for it! Office-hours appointments can be made for any reason: to discuss reading material or tasks that are unclear, to discuss homework exercises, etc. Be aware that only "dead" homework assignments can be discussed during office hours (i.e. assignments that have already been graded). I am open to making appointments for times that best suit you. You can email me to arrange an appointment, or ask me in person straight after the seminar on Friday. Students can arrange individual or group office-hour meetings.
			<br><br>I will endeavour to respond to your email within two working days, and to inform you of your homework grades before the next seminar. Please be patient!
<br><br>

<b>During seminars</b><br>
Please don't be late. If you need to leave the room, just leave. You don't need to ask for permission. If you wish to bring your laptop to class, please <b>don't</b> use it for making notes. Aside from competing with me for your attention, I find the sound of students typing rather distracting. Also, there is no need to take photos of slides: the slideshow from each seminar will be made available on this website after the seminar has finished (click the <b>materials</b> tab at the top of this page). If you really want to take a photo of the chalkboard, you can. But don't use a flash. Please leave me and your classmates out of photos.
<br><br>

<b>Missing seminars</b><br>
You may miss two non-consecutive seminars without explanation (on account of illness). More frequent or more extended periods of absence should be discussed with me. Frequent or extended periods of absence typically require external justification (e.g. a doctor's note).
