Welcome to the course website for Introduction to Morphology 2020! Before you begin browsing this site, please read the following message.<br><br>

All of the important information for this course can be found under the [<a class="link" name="general" style="cursor:pointer;"><b>General</b></a>] tab: the course's aims and objectives, how students will be assessed, what teaching policies will be adopted, etc. However, some of this information (such as where and when the seminar classes are held) is not currently relevant, and will only apply <b>after</b> the current Coronavirus restrictions are lifted and things return to normal. In the rest of this post, I describe how the course will proceed while the Coronavirus restrictions are still in place.<br><br>

<font color="red">Until further notice, this course will be conducted entirely online.</font><br><br>
<b>Lecture-style seminar classes.</b> I will pre-record the lecture-style seminar classes and upload the videos in .mp4 format at 10:15 on Fridays (starting 24 April 2020), so that students can watch the lectures in the timeslot that our classroom sessions would usually otherwise happen. Links to these videos will be posted under the [<a class="link" name="materials" style="cursor:pointer;"><b>Materials</b></a>] tab.<br><br>

<b>Tutorial-style seminar classes.</b> Every third week, we will have a tutorial-style session at Friday at 10:15 until 11:45. I will either (i) organise a Microsoft Teams video conference that we can all participate in or (ii) stream a webcast that includes a chat function. Links to these sessions will be posted under the [<a class="link" name="materials" style="cursor:pointer;"><b>Materials</b></a>] tab.<br><br>

<b>Office-hours meetings.</b> Please email me to schedule a meeting. My preference is for appointments within my usual office-hours timeslot (Wednesday 15:00 to 16:00), but I am happy to make appointments for other times and days during the week. The meeting itself will take place remotely, via Microsoft Teams or some similar software.<br><br>

As you can probably tell, I'm still working out many the details of how to teach this course remotely. Please check this website regularly for updates, as my plans are very likely to change!

			<div class="unfold">
			<p>
This linguistics proseminar provides an introduction to Morphology, which is the study of words, how they are formed, and how they relate to each other within the same language. Topics covered include: the nature and types of word-formation processes, the nature of compounding and cliticization, the nature of morphological productivity, and the interaction of morphology and phonology (morphophonology). The course will also include critical comparison of two prominent theoretical approaches that aim to explain the patterns of data we will encounter when discussing each topic. In addition to becoming adept at recognising different morphological patterns within and across languages, students taking this course will further develop their general analytical and research skills. Although much of the course will be focused on English, the morphology of a variety of languages will be discussed.

Classroom time will proceed in three-week cycles. The first two weeks of each cycle will follow a lecture format, whereas every third week will be devoted to a tutorial class, in which students will hone their new analytical skills through practical exercises. There are two assessments for this class: [i] a take-home mid-term exam, and [ii] a final exam.

			<p class="fold"><a>Aims and learning outcomes</a></p>
			<div class="unfold">
			<p>
A sound understanding of morphological theory and the tools of morphological analysis is indispensable for effective research in any other subfield of linguistics, and is especially crucial for linguistic fieldwork, typological studies, and experimental work. Knowledge of morphology is also useful for teaching language and grammar at all educational levels. More generally, engaging in formal morphological theory helps to develop and refine transferable analytical and argumentative skills.
<br><br>

In this class, students will develop and refine their analytical skills through applying them to a variety of familiar and unfamiliar morphological puzzles and problems. Although the teaching material will predominantly use English as the language of exemplification, students will also be introduced to interesting morphological patterns attested in a wide variety of other languages.</p>

<p><ul class="disc"> <b>Learning outcomes</b>
<li>An ability to identify morphological phenomena and categorise them according to their morphophonological impacts within a broader morphological system.</li> 
<li>An ability to recall/identify morphological rules and constraints and assess their efficacy.</li>
<li>An ability to identify morphological patterns in linguistic data and construct generalisations therefrom.</li>
<li>An ability to assess how well different morphological frameworks explain certain morphological patterns.</li>  
</ul></p><br>
</div>
</li>

<p class="fold"><a>Workload and course textbook</a></p>
<div class="unfold">
<p>
The textbook for this course is: <br><br>
<b>Martin Haspelmath & Andrea Sims</b>. 2010. <i>Understanding Morphology</i> (2nd edition). Publisher: Routledge.
<br><br>
This course is worth either 6 ECTS credits (if taken as a seminar), which corresponds to between 150 and 180 hours of work, or 3 ECTS credits (if taken as an &Uuml;bung), which corresponds to 75 to 90 hours of work (one credit = 25 to 30 hours of work). Because we will have 18 hours of classroom time (i.e. one 1,5 hour lecture/tutorial every week for 12 weeks), much of this work will be done outside of the classroom.
<br><br>
Students should use course-hours outside of the classroom to familiarise themselves with, and therefore ensure they have a firm understanding of, the material presented in each seminar class. This is primarily done by reading the chapters from the textbook on which this course is based. Although each week's seminar class will summarise the relevant chapters from the textbook, students are encouraged to read up on the relevant chapters before the relevant the seminar takes place. Each chapter ends with exercises, whose answers are in the back of the book. Students are encouraged to undertake some of these exercises (though this will not form part of the assessment for the course). <b>Note:</b>the questions in the mid-term and final exams are restricted to those topics covered in the seminars. You will not be tested on your knowledge of topics discussed in the textbook which are not discussed in the seminars.
</p><br>
			</div>

			<li>
			<p class="fold"><a>Assessment</a></p>
			<div class="unfold">
			
			<ul class="disc">
			<li>5% &nbsp&nbsp= Attendance and participation
			<li>30% = Homework assignments / take-home mid-term exam</li>
			<li>65% = Final exam</li>
			</ul><p>
			<br>
			<b>Attendance and participation</b><br>
Students are expected to attend every classroom session (for information about missing classroom sessions, please see the 'policies' section below). Students should be prepared to complete exercises during tutorials as part of a group, and are expected to contribute equally to this group work. Although they are still expected to attend every classroom session, <b>&Uuml;bung students</b> will not receive a grade for attendance and participation.
<br><br>

<b>Take-home mid-term exam</b><br>

Students will be issued with a mid-term take-home exam after the seminar class on <b>29 May 2020</b>. This can be done individually or in groups of up to 4 students. Students will have one week to complete the exam: the exam should be submitted no later than <b>12:00 (midday) on 05 June 2020</b>. <b>&Uuml;bung students</b> will complete an exam that is approximately half the length of the exam that seminar students must complete.
<br><br>
The mid-term exam must be submitted electronically to my email address, which is james.griffiths@uni-tuebingen.de. Answers to questions can be placed directly in the body of an email, be sent as a .docx/.odt/.pdf file, sent as a scanned file, or sent as an image taken from a smartphone. Anything submitted must be legible, and it must be clear in all submissions precisely which questions are being answered. Students must put their name and student number on all submissions. If the mid-term exam is being done as a group, each member of group must put his/her/their name and student number on the submission. Only one member of the group should email me: there is no need for every member to send me duplicates.
<br><br>
The exam questions are either created by me or taken from obscure textbooks. Students won't find the answers online or easily in print, so they shouldn't waste their time trying!
<br><br>
<b>The final exam</b><br>
The final exam will take place in the final tutorial class on <b>Friday 24 July 2020</b>, and will occupy the entire final tutorial (in other words, students will be given 1.5 hours to complete the exam). The final exam is done individually (i.e. <b>not</b> in groups), and is worth 65% of the final grade for the course. The questions on the exam will cover topics from all of the preceding seminars. Students may only take stationary (pens, pencils, rulers, etc.) into the exam. No exam aids (notes, revision cards, smartphones, etc.) can be taken into the exam. <b>&Uuml;bung students</b> will complete an exam that is approximately half the length of the exam that seminar students must complete.
<br><br>
Final exam submissions will be subject to standard tests for plagiarism. If discovered, plagiarism will be dealt with in accordance with the University of T&uuml;bingen's outstanding policies.
<br><br>
<b>The final grade</b><br>
The scores from the exams, which are may undergo some form of statistical normalisation, will be added together to produce a final grade, given as a percentage. These percentages translate into the T&uuml;bingen grading system as follows:
			<br>
			<table>
			<tr><td style="padding-right: 20px">95% or above</td><td>1</td></tr>
			<tr><td style="padding-right: 20px">90% or above</td><td>1,3</td></tr>
			<tr><td style="padding-right: 20px">85% or above</td><td>1,7</td></tr>
			<tr><td style="padding-right: 20px">80% or above</td><td>2</td></tr>
			<tr><td style="padding-right: 20px">75% or above</td><td>2,3</td></tr>
			<tr><td style="padding-right: 20px">70% or above</td><td>2,7</td></tr>
			<tr><td style="padding-right: 20px">65% or above</td><td>3</td></tr>
			<tr><td style="padding-right: 20px">60% or above</td><td>3,3</td></tr>
			<tr><td style="padding-right: 20px">55% or above</td><td>3,7</td></tr>
			<tr><td style="padding-right: 20px">50% or above</td><td>4</td></tr>
			<tr><td style="padding-right: 20px">49% or below</td><td>5</td></tr>
			</table>
<br>
Students who have a final grade of 49% or below (which corresponds to a 5 in the T&uuml;bingen system) will fail the course. A decision on whether the exam can be re-sat has not yet been taken. I will let students know in due course.
<!--<br><br>
For bureaucratic reasons, students must enroll on the <a class="sup" href="https://studis.uni-konstanz.de/" target="_blank">StudIS</a> system between 01 December 2017 and 15 January 2018 to be eligible for a final grade. Please add this to your calendar!-->

<b>Language of instruction</b><br>
The working language of this course is English. Seminars and tutorials will be conducted in English and the provided reading material will be written in English. Students must submit homework assignments in English, and must write their answers during the mid-term and final exam in English.
<br><br>

<b>Office-hour appointments</b><br>
This course is meant to be stimulating and challenging, but not overwhelming. So if you need help, please ask for it! Students may come individually or in groups to meet me during my office-hours (Wednesday, 15:00 to 16:00) for any reason: to discuss reading material or tasks that are unclear, to discuss exam exercises, to complain about the course-load, etc. Office-hours meetings are arranged on a first-come-first-serve basis: no prior appointment can be made. Be aware that only 'dead' assignments can be discussed during office hours (i.e. assignments that have already been graded). Although I have dedicated office-hours on Wednesday afternoon, I am open to making appointments for other times, for exceptional circumstances. You can email me to arrange an appointment, or ask me in person straight after one of the seminars or tutorials.
<br><br>I will endeavour to respond to your email within two working days, and to inform you of your exam grades before the next relevant class. Please be patient!
<br><br>

<b>During seminars and tutorials</b><br>
Please don't be late. If you need to leave the room, just leave. You don't need to ask for permission. If you wish to bring your laptop to class, please <b>don't</b> use it for making notes. Aside from competing with me for your attention, I find the sound of students typing rather distracting. Also, there is no need to take photos of slides: the slideshow from each seminar will be made available on this website after the seminar has finished (click the <b>materials</b> tab at the top of this page). If you really want to take a photo of the whiteboard, you can. But don't use a flash. Please leave me and your classmates out of photos.
<br><br>

<b>Missing seminars</b><br>
You may miss two non-consecutive seminars without explanation (on account of illness). More frequent or more extended periods of absence should be discussed with me. Frequent or extended periods of absence typically require external justification (e.g. a doctor's note).
