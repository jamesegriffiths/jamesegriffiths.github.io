			<div class="unfold">
			<p>
This seminar revisits a number of topics in morphology that were first discussed in Morphology I. These topics will be explored in greater depth, and particular attention will be paid to how different morphological frameworks approach these topics. In particular, the last section of the course introduces students to morphological analyses couched in the currently-popular <b>Distributed Morphology</b> framework. In addition to becoming more familiar with morphological analysis, students taking this seminar will further develop their general analytical and research skills. Although much of the course will be focused on English, the morphology of a variety of languages will be discussed.
</p><br>

			<li>
			<p class="fold"><a>Aims and learning outcomes</a></p>
			<div class="unfold">
			<p>
A sound understanding of morphological theory and the tools of morphological analysis is indispensable for effective research in any other subfield of linguistics, and is especially crucial for linguistic fieldwork, typological studies, and experimental work. Knowledge of morphology is also useful for teaching language and grammar at all educational levels. More generally, engaging in formal morphological theory helps to develop and refine transferable analytical and argumentative skills.
<br><br>

In this class, students will develop and refine their analytical skills through applying them to a variety of familiar and unfamiliar morphological puzzles and problems. Although the teaching material will predominantly use English as the language of exemplification, students will also be introduced to interesting morphological patterns attested in a wide variety of other languages.</p>


<p><ul class="disc"> <b>Learning outcomes</b>
<li>An ability to identify morphological phenomena and categorise them according to their morphophonological impacts within a broader morphological system.</li> 
<li>An ability to recall/identify morphological rules and constraints and assess their efficacy.</li>
<li>An ability to identify morphological patterns in linguistic data and construct generalisations therefrom.</li>
<li>An ability to assess how well different morphological frameworks explain certain morphological patterns.</li>  
</ul></p><br>

<p class="fold"><a>Workload and course textbook</a></p>
<div class="unfold">
<p>
TThis course is worth 6 ECTS credits, which corresponds to between 150 and 180 hours of work (one credit = 25 to 30 hours of work). Because we will have 30 hours of contact-time (i.e. one 1.5 hour seminar every week for 14 weeks, one 1.5 hour tutorial every other week, starting in week 2), much of this work will be done outside of the classroom.
<br><br>

Students will be issued with a mid-term take-home exam after the tutorial class in week 8 (07 June 2018). The number of questions on the exam will be determined by how much homework (if any) students are assigned in weeks 1 to 8: the more homework assigned, the fewer questions there will be on the exam. The exact ratio of homework to mid-term exam questions is not yet determined. Consequently, the homework and the mid-term exam are lumped together, and make up 30% of final grade. Information about how and when to submit homework and the mid-term exam can be found under the 'homework/mid-term assigments' tab below.
<br><br>
Students may also use course-hours outside of the classroom to read chapters from the textbook on which weeks 1 to 8 of this course is based. Although each week's seminar class will summarise the relevant chapters from the textbook, students are encouraged to read up on the relevant chapters in preparation for the seminar (this is not obligatory, however).

<!-- Consequently, students will receive additional reading tasks and homework assignments for the first 10 weeks or so. Reading tasks and homework assignments for each week will be bundled together as .zip file, which will be uploaded to this website after each seminar (click the <b>materials</b> tab at the top of this page). Students unfamiliar with .zip files should google "extract zip files {windows/mac/linux/android}" for instructions. Additional reading tasks and homework assignments should be tackled in the order suggested. -->
<br><br>

The textbook for weeks 1 to 8 of this course is: <br><br>
<b>Martin Haspelmath & Andrea Sims</b>. 2010. <i>Understanding Morphology</i> (2nd edition). Publisher: Routledge.
<br><br>
After week 8, we will stop using this textbook. Also, the remaining time outside of the classroom after week 8 is reserved for revision for the final exam.

			<ul class="disc">
			<li>5% &nbsp&nbsp= Attendance and participation
			<li>30% = Homework assignments</li>
			<li>65% = Final exam</li>
			</ul><p>
			<br>
			<b>Attendance and participation</b><br>
Students are expected to attend all of the seminars (for information about missing seminars, please see the 'policies' section below). Students should be prepared to complete exercises during seminars as part of a group, and are expected to contribute equally to this group work. Students are also expected to complete every homework exercise assigned to them and submit each one on time.
<br><br>

<b>Homework assignments / take-home mid-term exam</b><br>

If homework is assigned, it can be done individually or in groups of up to 4 students. Answers to homework assignments will be discussed in the following tutorial.<br><br>

If assigned, homework must be submitted <b>before 17:00 on the Wednesday before the following Thursday tutorial</b>. Any homework submission received after this deadline will not be graded and will therefore receive 0%.
<br><br>
Students will be issued with a mid-term take-home exam after the tutorial class in week 8 (<b>07 June 2018</b>). This can be done individually or in groups of up to 4 students. Students will have one week to complete the exam: the exam should be submitted no later than <b>17:00 on 14 June 2018</b>.
<br><br>
Homework assignments and the mid-term exam must be submitted electronically to my email address, which is james.griffiths@uni-konstanz.de. Answers to questions can be placed directly in the body of an email, be sent as a .docx/.odt/.pdf file, sent as a scanned file, or sent as an image taken from a smartphone. Anything submitted must be legible, and it must be clear in all submissions precisely which questions are being answered. Students must put their name and student number on all submissions. If homework and/or the mid-term exam are/is being done as a group, each member of group must put his/her/their name and student number on the submission. Only one member of the group should email me: there is no need for every member to send me duplicates.
<br><br>
The homework and exam questions are either created by me or taken from obscure textbooks. Students won't find the answers online or easily in print, so they shouldn't waste their time trying!
<br><br>
<b>The final exam</b><br>
The final exam will take place in the final tutorial class on <b>Thursday 19 July 2018</b>, and will occupy the entire final tutorial (in other words, students will be given 1.5 hours to complete the exam). The final exam is done individually (i.e. <b>not</b> in groups), and is worth 65% of the final grade for the course. The questions on the exam will cover topics from all of the preceding seminars. Students may only take stationary (pens, pencils, rulers, etc.) into the exam. No exam aids (notes, revision cards, smartphones, etc.) can be taken into the exam.
<br><br>
Final exam submissions will be subject to standard tests for plagiarism. If discovered, plagiarism will be dealt with in accordance with University of Konstanz's outstanding policies.
<br><br>
<b>The final grade</b><br>
The scores from the homework and the exams, which are likely to undergo some form of statistical normalisation, will be added together to produce a final grade, given as a percentage. These percentages translate into the Konstanz grading system as follows:
			<br>
			<table>
			<tr><td style="padding-right: 20px">95% or above</td><td>1</td></tr>
			<tr><td style="padding-right: 20px">90% or above</td><td>1,3</td></tr>
			<tr><td style="padding-right: 20px">85% or above</td><td>1,7</td></tr>
			<tr><td style="padding-right: 20px">80% or above</td><td>2</td></tr>
			<tr><td style="padding-right: 20px">75% or above</td><td>2,3</td></tr>
			<tr><td style="padding-right: 20px">70% or above</td><td>2,7</td></tr>
			<tr><td style="padding-right: 20px">65% or above</td><td>3</td></tr>
			<tr><td style="padding-right: 20px">60% or above</td><td>3,3</td></tr>
			<tr><td style="padding-right: 20px">55% or above</td><td>3,7</td></tr>
			<tr><td style="padding-right: 20px">50% or above</td><td>4</td></tr>
			<tr><td style="padding-right: 20px">49% or below</td><td>5</td></tr>
			</table>
<br>
Students who have a final grade of 49% or below (which corresponds to a 5 in the Konstanz system) will fail the course. A decision on whether the exam can be re-sat has not yet been taken. I will let students know in due course.
<!-- <br><br>
For bureaucratic reasons, students must enroll on the <a class="sup" href="https://studis.uni-konstanz.de/" target="_blank">StudIS</a> system between 01 December 2017 and 15 January 2018 to be eligible for a final grade. Please add this to your calendar!-->

			<p>
<b>Language of instruction</b><br>
The working language of this course is English. Seminars will be conducted in English and the provided reading material will be written in English. Students must submit homework assignments  in English, and must write their answers during the mid-term and final exam in English.
<br><br>

<b>Office-hour appointments</b><br>
This course is meant to be stimulating and challenging, but not overwhelming. So if you need help, please ask for it! Office-hours appointments can be made for any reason: to discuss reading material or tasks that are unclear, to discuss homework or exam exercises, to complain about the course-load, etc. Be aware that only 'dead' homework assignments can be discussed during office hours (i.e. assignments that have already been graded). Although I have dedicated office-hours on Wednesday afternoon, I am open to making appointments for times that best suit you. You can email me to arrange an appointment, or ask me in person straight after one of the seminars or tutorials. Students can arrange individual or group office-hour meetings.
			<br><br>I will endeavour to respond to your email within two working days, and to inform you of your homework/exam grades before the next relevant class. Please be patient!
<br><br>

<b>During seminars</b><br>
Please don't be late. If you need to leave the room, just leave. You don't need to ask for permission. If you wish to bring your laptop to class, please <b>don't</b> use it for making notes. Aside from competing with me for your attention, I find the sound of students typing rather distracting. Also, there is no need to take photos of slides: the slideshow from each seminar will be made available on this website after the seminar has finished (click the <b>materials</b> tab at the top of this page). If you really want to take a photo of the chalkboard, you can. But don't use a flash. Please leave me and your classmates out of photos.
<br><br>

<b>Missing seminars</b><br>
You may miss two non-consecutive seminars without explanation (on account of illness). More frequent or more extended periods of absence should be discussed with me. Frequent or extended periods of absence typically require external justification (e.g. a doctor's note).
