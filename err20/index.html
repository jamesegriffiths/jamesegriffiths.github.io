			<div class="unfold">
			<p>If participants in a conversation wish to avoid using redundant words, they often can. Although this phenomenon of ellipsis, which was illustrated the previous sentence (some words are missing after 'can') is ubiquitous in natural language, it cannot occur freely: it must obey certain grammatical rules. But what are these rules, why do they hold in the first place, and why do they differ across languages? From the perspective of linguistic theory, what exactly IS ellipsis, anyway? And how does ellipsis differ from other types of reduced registers, such as headlinese (e.g. "DOG BITES MAN") and textese (e.g. "going pub l8er, fancy it?")? Focusing primarily on English, this course outlines some of the answers that have been offered to these questions. The course provides students with an opportunity to (i) further refine their analytical skills by engaging with the problems for linguistic theory that ellipsis introduces, and (ii) become familiar with an aspect of English grammar that is seldom discussed in English language teaching textbooks yet used frequently in the spoken language. <br><br><b>Highly recommended:</b> a background in syntactic theory.</p><br>

			<b>Attendance and class contributions</b><br>
			As in any block course, we will cover a lot of material in a very short space of time. To ensure that you understand the issues being discussed, and to avoid falling behind, it is crucial that you engage with the primary literature assigned for each day (this literature is listed in the <a class='link' name='readings' style="cursor:pointer"><font color="#7D50C1"> Readings</font></a> section) <b>before</b> the classes for that day. You are not expected to understand every detail of these papers: you should read for the gist, paying particular attention to what empirical generalisations or typologies are being developed and/or what arguments are being made for or against a particular theoretical position. The aim of the classes is to summarise, clarify, synthesise, and criticise these papers. To streamline this process (and to help me quantify each student's level engagement with the required readings), <b>you are expected to come to each day's classes armed with at least three questions about the reading for that day</b>. These can be questions about any aspect of the reading: terminology you didn't understand, arguments that aren't clear, questions about data, criticisms, etc. These questions should be handed in to me (on a piece of paper) before classes start. 10% of the final grade comes from handing in these questions and from contributing positively during classes.
	<br><br>
	<b>Presentation of final essay</b><br>
	The main assessment for this course is an essay (see below for details). To help you plan and structure this essay, and to provide peer-feedback before you write up the final version, you will present your essay to me and your classmates during a meeting that will take place a few weeks after the block classes finish. Your presentation should be approximately 15 minutes long, and you should use slides. These can be made using MS PowerPoint, Apple Keynote, LaTeX Beamer, Prezi, or any other presentation software. You will then take questions from the audience during a 5-minute Q&A session afterwards, thus replicating the feel of a real academic conference. 
<br><br>
The date, place, and time of this meeting (which should last approximately 2.5 hours) is not yet decided. We will decide together, on the first day of classes, about when to meet.
			
<!--The schedule for presentations is available [<a class="sup" href="Final_presentation_schedule.pdf" target="_blank"><b>here</b></a>].-->
			<br><br> 
			<b>Final essay</b> [<i>written in English only</i>]<br>
			You will write an essay. As a guideline, the essay should be no fewer than 15 pages (single-spaced A4, 2.5cm margins, size 12 font) and no longer than 25 pages (approx. 7000-8000 words). 
			You are free to research any topic you wish, provided that it is related to ellipsis and/or reduced registers. Some recommendations are provided in the <a class='link' name='bibliography' style="cursor:pointer"><font color="#7D50C1">Bibliography</font></a> section.
			<br><br>
			You are strongly encouraged to submit an outline of your final essay to me (by email in either docx or pdf format) before you begin to prepare your presentation, so that I can provide some initial feedback. 
			This outline should include all (sub)section headings (e.g. &sect;1. Introduction, &sect;2. Previous studies, etc.) and a brief summary of the intended contents of each (sub)section. 
<br><br>
The date on which you must submit the final version of your essay (in either docx or pdf format) is not yet decided. We will decide together, on the first day of classes, on a suitable date. Nonetheless, once the date and time are determined, percentage points will be deducted for lateness (the later the essay is submitted, the more points are deducted).
			<br><br>
			While student cooperation is otherwise encouraged during this course, final essays must be undertaken individually. Students will be discouraged from working on very similar topics, and all essays will be subject to standard tests for plagiarism. Plagiarism, if discovered, will be dealt with in accordance with University of T&uuml;bingen's outstanding policies.
			<br><br>
			Advice on how to write the final essay, plus the grading criteria, can be found [<a class="sup" href="essay_advice.pdf" target="_blank">here</a>].
			<br><br>
			You must obtain an overall grade of 50% or higher to pass the course and therefore gain your credits. Here's how the final percentage translates into the T&uuml;bingen grading system:

			<p>
<b>Language of instruction</b><br>
The working language of this course is English. Classes will be conducted in English and the provided reading material will be written in English. Students must submit all questions and assignments in English.
<br><br>

<b>Office-hour appointments</b><br>
This class is meant to be stimulating, not overwhelming. If concepts aren't clear, if the pace is too quick, or if the workload is too heavy, please tell me, either during the class itself, or during breaks, or via email. Although there won't be an opportunity for typical "office-hours" meetings during the block-teaching week itself, such meetings can be arranged during the weeks that follow it, i.e. after the teaching-week finishes but before the essay deadline.
			<br><br>I aim to respond to your email within two working days, and to inform you of grades within two weeks of being assessed. Please be patient!
<br><br>

<b>During seminars and tutorials</b><br>
Please don't be late. If you need to leave the room, just leave. You don't need to ask for permission. If you wish to bring your laptop to class, please <b>don't</b> use it for making notes, unless you cannot write by hand for a medical reason (or something similar). Aside from competing with me for your attention, I find the sound of students typing rather distracting. Also, there is no need to take photos of slides: any slideshows I use will be made available on this website after the seminar has finished <!--(click the <b>materials</b> tab at the top of this page)-->. If you really want to take a photo of the chalkboard, you can. But don't use a flash. Please leave me and your classmates out of photos.
<br><br>

<b>Missing classes</b><br>
Because this is a block course, full attendence is expected. Absence for small periods will be tolerated provided that you tell me far enough in advance (i.e. before the course begins, via email) and you can justify your absence (e.g. with a doctor's note). If you are struggling to find childcare during this period, please tell me as soon as possible, in case I can help.
